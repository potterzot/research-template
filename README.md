Research-Template
-----------------

This is the github repository for my research template. I attempt to strike a balance between an R package-based template like [Ropensci's rrrpkg](http://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg) and something like [projecttemplate](), in which any software are kept as subdirectories within the project directory. I really like the benefits of R package-based templates, but wanted more flexibility in directory structure and ease of including work in other languages. I like some of the organization of projecttemplate, but it feels like it tries to do too much for my tastes.

Approach
--------

The idea behind this approach is make use of the R package development tools while also allowing some flexibility in how you organize things.
