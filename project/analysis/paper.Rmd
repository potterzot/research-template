# Current Research
This is the only way 

$x = \alpha$.

``` {r}
x <- 5
x

```

# Here is a plot

``` {r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = rnorm(10))
ggplot(data = df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```



# Future Research Plans
There should still be a way to cite things like [@Phillips1991].
